Pisidia Marble Trading
We are a marble trading company from Pisidia – Isparta / Turkiye. We work with quarries and tile processing factories located in the marble region of Turkiye, which corresponds to the ancient region of Pisidia; hence our company name.
As Pisidia Marble Trading, we provide cut to size, polished, ready to install, high quality marble tiles, for marble flooring&cladding in the interiors of buildings; continuing to bring the glance of ancient Pisidian marble - of which the remnants of so many famous temples, and theatres are still to be seen in historic places in our region - into the buildings and housings of our modern times. 
Knowing the quarries, the pattern of the stones extracted, and the factories' capacities as well as their management, give us a deep reach into raw materials and production processes which are necessary to ensure a smooth pattern throughout all the crates when supplying high quantities for hotels, shopping malls, or other large scale flooring and cladding projects. 
With a keen eye on production quality, regular factory visits, and our own dedicated team inspecting the selection of the tiles before they are put into crates; we assure that our clients receive what they want.
Dedicated selection teams first lay out the finished tiles on the floor and only after ensuring a smooth pattern they put the tiles with delicate care into various crates according to their pattern, which are then numbered and marked not only by tile size but also and especially by the tile pattern each crate contains. Thus, we make sure, once an order is received, only the relevant patterns of crates are picked for that shipment. 
Using high quality wooden crates and extra Styrofoam material for cushioning ensures a relatively safe travel over truck, crane and ship to other sides of the world. 

We see, furthermore, our role not yet finished at the time of shipment. After sales is also as important to us as closing a deal was before. 
With our sales team fluent in English and German, and our logistics and accounting departments highly experienced in their fields, we also make sure all the procedural issues are dealt with due care. 
Our customers are sure not only of the quality they have demanded is what is being shipped; but also, when they write us, or simply reach out for their phones and call us, despite any time zone difference, they are sure they can reach us, their emails are replied, and their calls are taken.Thus, being reachable for our clients is paramount for us in our business conduct.
Headquartered in Isparta City, 75 miles (120 km) north of Antalya International Airport; and educated workforce fluent in English and German, we are not only easily reachable, but also easily talkable. 
We talk with you. Understand what you want. Make our offer. Provide agreed products. We also make sure any paper work is handled with due care appropriately. 
Keeping an after sales contact is paramount to our business; as we want to work with the same client again and again at next orders as well.  
Customer satisfaction is bigger written in our  business code than making profit.
